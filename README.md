## Stretch Challenges

* Make an api route for transfering money from one account to another. Set up the front end to be able to make a call to this route.
* Currently the get_all_accounts api route only prints to the console. Make a front end able to access this route and display a list of all the accounts.

## Super Stretch

* Add roles to each account and only have certain roles be able to access certain endpoints
